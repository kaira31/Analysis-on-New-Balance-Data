# Analysis-on-New-Balance-Data
# Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing data from New-Balance, focusing on data preparation, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and performing various clustering methods to uncover insights about running footwear and apparel consumers.

# Key Steps:
Data Preparation: Prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring data integrity and suitability for clustering algorithms.
Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, distributions, and relationships between variables.
# Clustering Methods:
First K-Means: Apply K-Means clustering algorithm to segment consumers based on their preferences and behaviors.
Second K-Medoids: Implement K-Medoids clustering to further explore consumer segments and validate findings.
Third Gaussian Mixture: Utilize Gaussian Mixture clustering to capture underlying data distributions and identify consumer clusters.
Fourth Agglomerative Clustering: Employ Agglomerative Clustering to reveal hierarchical structures in the data and identify potential consumer segments.
# Results Analysis:
Evaluate clustering algorithms based on Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index to assess the quality and separation of clusters.
Provide justification, observations, insights, and considerations for each clustering method based on the evaluation metrics.
Recommendations:
Offer product recommendations and marketing strategies tailored to each identified consumer cluster, leveraging insights from the clustering analysis.
# Results Summary:
K-Means Clustering: Shows strong potential with high Silhouette Score and low Davies-Bouldin Index, indicating well-defined and separated clusters.
K-Medoids Clustering: Provides meaningful clustering but may be considered less optimal compared to K-Means.
Gaussian Mixture Clustering: Performs similarly to K-Means, offering a probabilistic approach to clustering.
Agglomerative Clustering: Provides reasonable results and reveals hierarchical structures in the data.

# Conclusion:
The analysis provides valuable insights into consumer segments within the running footwear and apparel market. By understanding consumer preferences and behaviors, New-Balance can tailor its product offerings, marketing strategies, and engagement initiatives to better serve its diverse customer base.
